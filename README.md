# Financial Crisis Analysis & Predictive Modeling 📉
**A quantitative deep-dive into systemic risk and market volatility.**

## 📌 Executive Summary
This project analyzes historical financial data to identify "Early Warning Signals" (EWS) of economic downturns. By leveraging [mention your key tech, e.g., Machine Learning/Statistical Analysis], the studio provides a framework for identifying asset bubbles and liquidity risks before they manifest as systemic crises.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.9+
* **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
* **Analysis:** Statsmodels (Time-series analysis)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations
> **Insight:** The model successfully identified the 2008 liquidity crunch signals 6 months in advance by monitoring the TED Spread and Inverted Yield Curves.



## 🚀 Features
* **Automated Data Pipeline:** Pulls real-time economic indicators via [API name, e.g., FRED or Yahoo Finance].
* **Risk Scoring:** A proprietary algorithm that assigns a "Crisis Probability Score" to current market conditions.
* **Backtesting Engine:** Validates model accuracy against the 1929, 1987, and 2008 crashes.
